The definition of done (DoD) is when all conditions that a software product must satisfy are met and ready to be accepted by a user, customer, team, or consuming system.

Definition of Done for user stories


The most common use of DoD is on the delivery team level. Done on this level means the Product Owner reviewed and accepted the user story. You must meet all of the defined standards or the user story isnâ€™t done.

Definition of Done vs. acceptance criteria

Acceptance criteria is unique to each user story, feature, or issue in question.

Definition of done is considered for everything, product management should review the definition and make sure they agree that it is comprehensive enough.

A Definition of Done should be as simple and short as possible. The idea is to create consistent quality and not bureaucratic hurdles that slow things down unnecessarily.
